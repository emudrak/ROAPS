Simulations of theoretical models

N0=5, r=0.06


Population growth over random period of years (uniform distrib 0 to 100 yrs since last disturbance)
1- density independent 
  Nt=N0exp(rt)
  N0=5, r=0.06, t~Unif(0,100)
2- density dependent K=100
  Nt=(K*N0exp(rt))/(K+N(exp(rt)-1))
3- K flucturates K~unif(1,100)






```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
